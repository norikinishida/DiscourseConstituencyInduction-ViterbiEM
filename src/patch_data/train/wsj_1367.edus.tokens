When Anne Volokh and her family immigrated to the U.S. 14 years ago ,
they started life in Los Angeles with only $ 400 .
They 'd actually left the Soviet Union with $ 480 ,
but during a stop in Italy Ms. Volokh dropped $ 80 on a black velvet suit .
Not surprisingly , she quickly adapted to the American way .
Three months after she arrived in L.A.
she spent $ 120
she did n't have
for a hat .
( " A turban , "
she specifies ,
" though it was n't the time for that 14 years ago .
But I loved turbans . " )
Since then she has become wealthy .
Her husband and older son
-- a computer prodigy
profiled in The Wall Street Journal in 1981 ,
when he was 13 --
run a software company with expected sales this year of $ 10 million .
Most recently , she has become the publisher of Movieline , a four - year - old Los Angeles magazine
that began national distribution last month , with an initial press run of 100,000 copies .
Distributed by the Hearst Corp. 's Eastern News ,
the glossy publication melds Vanity Fair 's gossipy archness and Premiere 's earnest delving into behind - the - scenes minutiae , with a special emphasis on Tinseltown as fashion trendsetter .
It 's being sold through bookstores , newsstands and some video stores .
Though Ms. Volokh is a small woman ,
she has an outsized personality and dramatic flair
that seem perfectly suited to capitalism
as it is practiced in Hollywood .
Certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in Kiev ,
when she lived with her parents , her husband and her two sons in a 2 1/2-room apartment
in what she calls " silent internal immigration , "
dreaming of escape .
Now , for example , she owns 48 hats .
However , she remembers the lean years
and recalls with relish wearing her first major American purchase
-- that turban --
10 years later and having a Los Angeles boutique owner ask her
if it was a Chanel .
With obvious satisfaction , she says
she told him :
" No darling , I just give it a Chanel look . "
She keeps track of the rest of her hats
by stapling Polaroid snapshots to the outside of each hatbox .
Are the hats merely part of her new L.A. persona , along with the many ultra - thin Capri cigarettes
she smokes ,
the parties
she throws for 500 people ,
the Chekovian feasts
she offers guests at her weekend place in Santa Barbara ?
" No , darling , "
she said recently in her fluent , slightly affected English , during a trip East
to promote Movieline 's national expansion .
" You have to be born with it .
I used to wear hats in Russia ,
but I had to make them and my dresses .
On the hat side I was n't getting what I wanted . "
Now 48 years old , Ms. Volokh has definite ideas
about what she wants .
At Movieline , she wants " specific paragraphing , specific tone , a specific attitude
-- bright and bold and tongue - in - cheek . "
In restaurants
( in this case , the Russian Samovar , a New York restaurant
operated by and for Soviet emigres ) ,
she did n't want the chirpy , folkish music bouncing through the room .
" You people here think
this is Russian music , "
she said with disdain ,
and called over to the waitress :
" Could you turn it off ? "
That done ,
Ms. Volokh spoke with rampant eloquence about the many attributes
she feels
she was born with :
an understanding of food , business , Russian culture , human nature , and parties .
" Parties are rather a state of mind , "
she said ,
pausing
only to taste and pass judgment on the Georgian shashlik
( " a little well done , but very good " ) .
" If you are born
to give parties ,
you give parties .
Even in Russia we managed to give parties .
In Los Angeles , in our lean years , we gave parties . "
As publisher of a magazine
devoted to movies as guideposts for fashion and other fantasies ,
Ms. Volokh sees her party - giving as an important part of business .
She has thrown extravagant soirees for crowds of people ,
but prefers more intimate gatherings .
" At American cocktail parties everyone 's always looking over your shoulder
to see
who they can talk to next .
I like rather tea ,
because it is at the end of the day . "
She serves high Russian tea , at 5 p.m.
" It 's supposed to be later
but I just moved it .
In Los Angeles , it 's important to catch people just after work . "
She also frequently invites directors , producers , actors , writers and other show business people for " coffee and clips in the pleasure dome . "
Guests bring movies on tape ,
and show their favorite three - to - five minute segments on the screen
that unrolls from the ceiling of the Volokhs ' art - nouveau library
( " the pleasure dome " ) .
They eat " sinful and sensual things "
-- and explain their clips .
" It 's very revealing and soul baring , "
said Ms. Volokh .
The idea for Movieline actually was dreamed up by an old friend of the Volokhs , Boris Krutchensky
( who has the title of co - publisher ) ,
and Laurie Halpern Smith , now the magazine 's co - editor .
Mr. Krutchensky approached Ms. Volokh five years ago about backing the publication ,
which started out as a listing guide .
She was interested
only if she could guide it editorially as well .
" Anne does n't believe in blandness , "
said Ms. Smith .
" She wants things to be exciting .
And she has this inexhaustible energy .
She 'll think of an idea
the editorial people think is impossible ,
then she 'll have us make it work . "
In fact , Ms. Volokh was n't just a rich lady
who needed a hobby .
Back in the Soviet Union she was a respected journalist ,
writing a weekly column about the national cuisine for Sunday Izvestia .
Those columns
-- vivid discussions of the cultural and literary reverberations of food as well as practical advice
on how to glamorize dreary Sovietized meals --
became the basis for her erudite and entertaining cookbook , " The Art of Russian Cuisine , "
brought out in 1983 by Macmillan Publishing Co.
" I do n't trust people
who do n't eat , "
said Ms. Volokh ,
though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago
to drop 25 pounds .
" Look at Dostoevski and Kafka .
No one ever eats in their books
and look at them . . . .
Tolstoy 's characters eat , Pushkin 's , Gogol 's . "
In her cookbook ,
which Macmillan is bringing out in soft cover this month
( with the blini recipe revised
so it works ) ,
she introduces each chapter with appropriate quotations from Russian literature :
Pushkin on blini , Goncharov on piroghi .
In life , she offers practical dieting advice :
" Divide your meals into important and unimportant .
In a great restaurant , do n't deprive yourself .
The other meals do n't matter . "
Amusing as she is ,
and frivolous as she can seem ,
this is a serious person with some difficult memories .
She was the child of relative privilege .
Her mother was a translator ;
her father was " the eternal vice director . "
" I emigrated
to wear better hats ,
do better parties , "
she said with a giggle .
" But we should n't leave out political reasons , number one .
You try to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances .
One can not imagine how you live
when you live those double and triple lives . "
By 1973 ,
after their second child was born ,
it had become clear to Ms. Volokh and her husband Vladimir , a computer scientist , that they wanted to leave the U.S.S.R.
Ms. Volokh quit her job ,
to remove herself from the public eye .
The wait was miserable .
Before granting Ms. Volokh 's parents a visa ,
the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband ,
whom she had divorced 38 years earlier .
Mr. Volokh was fired from his job ,
and had to endure hours of organized verbal abuse from his co - workers , accusations of sabotage and counterrevolutionary activities .
The Volokhs were afraid
that they 'd end up like a friend of theirs
who 'd applied for a visa
and waited for 10 years ,
having been demoted from his profession of theoretical mathematician to shipping clerk .
They did n't .
Their visa came in relatively short order ,
and they moved to Los Angeles .
Mr. Volokh soon found work in his field ,
but Ms. Volokh refused the obvious and available occupation
- as translatorfor a Russian
who spoke fluent English .
" That 's always looking back , "
she said .
" I wanted to be in business . "
On the way to that goal , she received her first U.S. paycheck
for proofreading a book of Polish poetry ,
attended secretarial school ,
then went to work for a fund - raising organization .
Soon she was running the office .
When her husband and son founded their computer company , Vesoft ,
she worked as business manager , bookkeeper and publicist .
Now Movieline is located in the same building as Vesoft .
" Things work out unexpectedly in life , "
said Ms. Volokh .
" You never know
if you 'll be chosen to be the scapegoat or the lucky one .
We were lucky . "
