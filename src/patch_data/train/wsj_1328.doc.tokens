Manville , having rid itself of asbestos , now sells fiberglass , forest products , minerals and industrial goods .
Heady stuff it 's not .

But Manville 's ownership is unusual , and it has caught the eye of some canny -- and patient -- investors .
The Denver - based concern , which emerged from bankruptcy - law proceedings late last year , is controlled by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust .
The trust , which owns 80 % of Manville 's stock on a fully diluted basis , is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims .

When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its Manville stock to cash .
But as an 80 % owner , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares .

Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market .

" Their principal asset is Manville common stock , " says Jeffrey Halis , who runs Sabre Associates , an investment fund that owns Manville shares . " If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail .
What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares . "

The trust is n't commenting on when it might need to liquefy its Manville stock .
However , the trust 's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims .
Its cash and liquid securities fell by $ 338 million in the first six months of 1989 .

The trust also will receive $ 75 million a year starting in 1991 on a bond it holds from Manville .
And , beginning in 1992 , it will have a claim on as much as 20 % of Manville 's annual net income .
Even so , the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch .
As of June 30 , it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims , for an average of $ 40,424 each . ( The average should drop over time , since the most expensive claims are being settled first ) .
And as of midyear , settled but unpaid claims amounted to $ 136 million -- more than half the trust 's total of $ 268 million in cash and marketable securities . " At some point , we 're going to need an infusion of funds , " a person close to the trust says .

Even before then , the trust may be eager to unload Manville stock .
It does n't pay a dividend , and this trust needs income .
Moreover , with 88 % of its assets tied up in Manville , the trust is badly in need of diversification . " Obviously , a diversified portfolio would have less risk , " the person close to the trust says .

Manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring .
Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post - bankruptcy law structure , Bill Bullock , Manville 's head of investor relations , says the company is continually pondering " whether there is a better way to be structured .
We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , " he says .

Of course , one option would be for Manville to buy out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders .
But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before November 1993 .
And both the trust and Manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the Manville name .
Thus , analysts say , the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville 's other shareholders . " This is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders , " one investor says .

Even if there is no restructuring , Manville seems to be attractive long - term .
Its stock , at 9 5/8 , trades at about 8 1/2 times estimated 1989 earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession - sensitive customers .
Mr. Bullock says 45 % of revenues are tied to construction .
Analysts predict little or no near - term growth .

They are , nonetheless , high on Manville 's management . " It 's one of the best in the business , " says Salomon Brothers analyst Stephen Dobi .
And he says Manville has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible moment when other construction - related firms are hurting and selling cheap .
With a conservative debt - to - equity ratio of 1-to-1 -- and $ 329 million in cash -- Manville is indeed actively on the prowl .

So far , as a price - conscious shopper , Manville has n't bought much .
Paul Kleinaitis , an analyst at Duff & Phelps , says , " Even though they have borrowing power , they have been disciplined about acquisitions . " And Mr. Kleinaitis says that with 80 % of its stock in friendly hands , Manville is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short - term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul .
