Toni Johnson pulls a tape measure across the front of what was once a stately Victorian home .
A deep trench now runs along its north wall ,
exposed
when the house lurched two feet off its foundation during last week 's earthquake .
A side porch was ripped away .
The chimney is a pile of bricks on the front lawn .
The remainder of the house leans precariously against a sturdy oak tree .
The petite , 29-year - old Ms. Johnson ,
dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt
as she slogs through the steady afternoon rain ,
is a claims adjuster with Aetna Life & Casualty .
She has been on the move almost incessantly since last Thursday ,
when an army of adjusters ,
employed by major insurers ,
invaded the San Francisco area
to help policyholders sift through the rubble and restore some order to their lives .
Equipped with cellular telephones , laptop computers , calculators and a pack of blank checks ,
they parcel out money
so their clients can find temporary living quarters ,
buy food ,
replace lost clothing ,
repair broken water heaters ,
and replaster walls .
Some of the funds will used
to demolish unstable buildings
and clear sites for future construction .
Many adjusters are authorized to write checks for amounts up to $ 100,000 on the spot .
They do n't flinch at writing them .
" That 's my job
-- get { policyholders } what they 're entitled to , "
says Bill Schaeffer , a claims supervisor
who flew in from Aetna 's Bridgeport , Conn. , office .
The Victorian house
that Ms. Johnson is inspecting
has been deemed unsafe by town officials .
But she asks a workman
toting the bricks from the lawn
to give her a boost through an open first - floor window .
Once inside , she spends nearly four hours
measuring and diagramming each room in the 80-year - old house ,
gathering enough information
to estimate what it would cost to rebuild it .
She snaps photos of the buckled floors and the plaster
that has fallen away from the walls .
While she works inside ,
a tenant returns with several friends
to collect furniture and clothing .
One of the friends sweeps broken dishes and shattered glass from a countertop
and starts to pack what can be salvaged from the kitchen .
Others grab books , records , photo albums , sofas and chairs ,
working frantically in the fear
that an aftershock will jolt the house again .
The owners , William and Margie Hammack , are luckier than many others .
A few years ago , Mrs. Hammack insisted on buying earthquake insurance for this house ,
which had been converted into apartments .
Only about 20 % of California home and business owners carried earthquake coverage .
The Hammacks ' own home , also in Los Gatos , suffered comparatively minor damage .
Ms. Johnson ,
who works out of Aetna 's office in Walnut Creek , an East Bay suburb ,
is awed by the earthquake 's destructive force .
" It really brings you down to a human level , "
she says .
" It 's hard to accept all the suffering
people are going through ,
but you have to .
If you do n't ,
you ca n't do your job . "
For Aetna and other insurers , the San Francisco earthquake hit
when resources in the field already were stretched .
Most companies still are trying to sort through the wreckage
caused by Hurricane Hugo in the Carolinas last month .
Aetna ,
which has nearly 3,000 adjusters ,
had deployed about 750 of them in Charlotte , Columbia , and Charleston .
Adjusters
who had been working on the East Coast
say
the insurer will still be processing claims from that storm through December .
It could take six to nine months to handle the earthquake - related claims .
When the earthquake rocked northern California last week ,
Aetna senior claims executives from the San Francisco area were at the company 's Hartford , Conn. , headquarters for additional training
on how to handle major catastrophes ,
including earthquakes .
Since commercial airline flights were disrupted ,
the company chartered three planes
to fly these executives back to the West Coast
and bring along portable computers , cellular phones and some claims adjusters .
Because of the difficulty
of assessing the damages
caused by the earthquake ,
Aetna pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country .
Even so , few had ever dealt with an earthquake .
Some adjusters , like Alan Singer of San Diego , had been working in Charleston for nearly four weeks .
He returned home last Thursday ,
packed a bag with fresh clothes
and reported for duty Friday in Walnut Creek .
Offices were set up in San Francisco and San Jose .
In a few instances , Aetna knew
it would probably be shelling out big bucks ,
even before a client called or faxed in a claim .
For example , officials at Walnut Creek office learned
that the Amfac Hotel near the San Francisco airport ,
which is insured by Aetna ,
was badly damaged
when they saw it on network television news .
" The secret
to being a good adjuster
is counting , "
says Gerardo Rodriguez , an Aetna adjuster from Santa Ana .
" You have to count everything . "
Adjusters must count the number of bathrooms , balconies , fireplaces , chimneys , microwaves and dishwashers .
But they must also assign a price to each of these items as well as to floors , wallcoverings , roofing and siding ,
to come up with a total value for a house .
To do that ,
they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot , carpeting by the square yard , wallpaper by the roll , molding by the linear foot .
Using a calculator and a unit - price guide for such jobs as painting , plumbing and roofing in each major region of the country ,
adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today 's market and what it would cost
to rebuild it .
Sometimes repairs are out of the question .
When Aetna adjuster Bill Schaeffer visited a retired couple in Oakland last Thursday ,
he found them living in a mobile home
parked in front of their yard .
The house itself ,
located about 50 yards from the collapsed section of double - decker highway Interstate 880 ,
was pushed about four feet off its foundation
and then collapsed into its basement .
The next day , Mr. Schaeffer presented the couple with a check for $ 151,000
to help them build a new home in the same neighborhood .
He also is working with a real - estate agent
to help find them an apartment
to rent
while their home is being built .
Many of the adjusters
employed by Aetna and other insurers
have some experience with construction work or carpentry .
But such skills were alien to Toni Johnson .
Four years ago , she was managing a film - processing shop
and was totally bored .
A friend mentioned
that she might want to look into a position at Aetna ,
if she was interested in a job
that would constantly challenge her .
She signed up ,
starting as an " inside " adjuster ,
who settles minor claims
and does a lot of work by phone .
A year later , she moved to the commercial property claims division .
She spent a month at an Aetna school in Gettysburg , Pa. ,
learning all about the construction trade ,
including masonry , plumbing and electrical wiring .
That was followed by three months at the Aetna Institute in Hartford ,
where she was immersed in learning how to read and interpret policies .
Her new line of work has some perils .
Recently , a contractor saved her from falling three stories
as she investigated what remained of an old Victorian house
torched by an arsonist .
" I owe that contractor .
I really do , "
she says .
As Ms. Johnson stands outside the Hammack house
after winding up her chores there ,
the house begins to creak and sway .
The ground shakes underneath her .
It is an aftershock , one of about 2,000 since the earthquake ,
and it makes her uneasy .
The next day ,
as she prepares a $ 10,000 check for the Hammacks ,
which will cover the cost
of demolishing the house
and clearing away the debris ,
she jumps at the slightest noise .
On further reflection , she admits
that venturing inside the Hammacks ' house the previous day was n't " such a great idea . "
During her second meeting with the Hammacks , Ms. Johnson reviews exactly what their policy covers .
They would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor ,
but wonder
if it 's safe to venture inside .
Ms. Johnson tells them
that ,
if the appliances ca n't be salvaged ,
their policy covers the replacement cost .
Mr. Hammack is eager to know
what Aetna will pay for the house ,
which has to come down .
" When will I get that check for a million dollars ? "
he jokes .
The adjuster had n't completed all the calculations ,
but says
: " We 're talking policy limits . "
In this case , that 's about $ 250,000 .
It suddenly dawns on Mr. Hammack
that rebuilding the house in Los Gatos , an affluent community in Santa Clara County , may cost
more than Aetna 's policy will pay .
" We can lose money on this , "
he says .
" And you did n't want me to buy earthquake insurance , "
says Mrs. Hammack ,
reaching across the table
and gently tapping his hand .
Earthquake insurance costs about $ 2 to $ 4 annually for every $ 1,000 of value ,
and high deductibles mean it generally pays
only when there is a catastrophe .
So , many Californians believe
they can get by
without it .
Even Ms. Johnson herself made that assumption .
" I always knew
that the ' Big One ' was coming ,
but not during my lifetime , "
she says .
Now she says
she 's thinking of contacting her own insurance agent .
For Ms. Johnson , dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience .
She lives in Oakland , a community
hit hard by the earthquake .
She did n't have hot water for five days .
The apartment
she shares with a 12-year - old daughter and her sister
was rattled ,
books and crystal hit the floor ,
but nothing was severely damaged .
Her sister , Cynthia , wishes
Toni had a different job .
" We worry about her out there , "
Cynthia says .
Last Sunday , Ms. Johnson finally got a chance
to water her plants ,
but stopped abruptly .
" I realized
I could n't waste this water
when there are people in Watsonville
who do n't have fresh water
to drink . "
She has n't played any music
since the earthquake hit ,
out of respect for those
who died on Interstate 880
where the roadway collapsed .
