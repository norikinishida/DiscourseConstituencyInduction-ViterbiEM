Medieval philosophers used to hold the sensible belief
that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist ,
and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all .
Now , only God exists as a matter of absolute necessity ;
it is built into His nature .
But since the time of Darwin , we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species .
Are n't we , after all , the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution ?
If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life ,
then it was only a matter of eons
before splendid beings
endowed with reason , self - awareness and taste
shimmered onto the scene .
Now along comes Stephen Jay Gould
to dash this flattering illusion .
His credentials are excellent for the task .
Star lecturer at Harvard , author of numerous popular books on science , and scourge of the creationist lobby , Mr. Gould is perhaps the world 's most eminent evolutionary theorist .
Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story
handed down from Darwin .
For him , natural history is anything but a gradual , predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness ;
it is a careening , chaotic affair
in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one - in - a - million shot .
In " Wonderful Life :
The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History "
( Norton , 326 pages , $ 19.95 ) ,
Mr. Gould makes his case for " the awesome improbability of human evolution . "
The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies
called the Burgess Shale .
Here , in an area smaller than a city block , lay buried traces of countless weird creatures
that had frolicked more than 500 million years ago --
creatures
whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world 's oceans today .
Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man
who discovered the Burgess Shale , one Charles Doolittle Walcott .
The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said
that animals
living so long ago
must be simple in design ,
limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species .
Accordingly , the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the Burgess fossils in such a way
that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories .
It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof. Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale .
By making clever inferences
about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three - dimensional structures ,
this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet .
One was so fantastic in appearance ,
it was dubbed Hallucigenia .
Would that Mr. Gould 's minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful .
A good deal of the book is boring , particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text .
These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like , " Most modern chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma . "
Interest picks up , though ,
when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution .
Not long after the appearance of life , evidently , there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs
seen on the earth .
The vast majority of them , however , were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals
that were too sudden and catastrophic
for the normal rules of natural selection to operate .
Consequently , the winnowing process was like a lottery
" in which each group { held } a ticket
unrelated to its anatomical virtues . "
So much for survival of the fittest .
So much , too , for the notion
that we humans triumphed in the Darwinian struggle
by evolving big brains .
Our mammalian forerunners lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact
that did in the dinosaurs
because they were small , not smart .
If anyone has difficulty imagining a world
in which history went merrily on without us ,
Mr. Gould sketches several .
In one , birds are the dominant carnivores ;
in another the seas abound with " little penises . "
Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing ,
it seems ,
human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone
called Pikaia .
Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating ;
like an existentialist of old , he views our contingency as " a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility . "
I , by contrast , can not help feeling
that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead ,
beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion .
But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all ,
the universe is a big place ,
and given the right conditions ,
sympathetic to creating some form of life .
Surely at some other cosmic address a Gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze
to explain why ,
paleontologically speaking ,
" it is , indeed , a wonderful life . "
