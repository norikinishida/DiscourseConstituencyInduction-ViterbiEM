SMYRNA , Ga. --
The auto - dealer strip in this booming suburb runs nearly five miles along Cobb Parkway ,
stretching from the Perimeter highway
that circles Atlanta
to the " Big Chicken , " a pullet - roofed fast - food restaurant and local landmark .
Twenty years ago , in the infancy of suburban sprawl , just a handful of dealerships were here .
Now there are 23 .
Alongside such long - familiar names as Chevrolet , Ford and Dodge are nameplates
that did n't exist until three years ago :
Acura , Sterling , Hyundai .
Under construction is the strip 's 24th showroom , the future home of Lexus , a luxury marque
launched by Toyota Motor Corp. just two months ago .
The 1980s have spawned an explosion of consumer choice in America , in everything from phone companies to colas .
And especially ,
as the Cobb Parkway strip attests ,
in cars .
Americans now can choose among 572 different models of cars , vans and trucks , up from just 408
when the decade began ,
according to Automotive News , a trade publication .
For car marketers , it has become a much tougher battle
to keep loyal customers from defecting to one of the new makes on the block .
For American car buyers , the proliferation of choice is both liberating and confusing .
Malcolm MacDougall , vice chairman of the Jordan , McGrath , Case & Taylor advertising agency in New York , calls the proliferation " nameplate mania . "
He says
the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today ,
and that people will simply ignore new models
that lack a well - defined image .
" The winners , "
he predicts ,
" will be brands from car makers
that have traditionally been associated with quality and value . "
He says
it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible
while still retaining links to the parent company 's quality image .
He applauds Toyota and Nissan Motor Co.
for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models ,
rather than simply adding more nameplates to their standard car lines .
Some auto executives believe
the benefits of more choice outweigh the drawbacks .
" There 's more noise out there ,
and the consumer may have to work harder
to cut through it , "
says Vincent P. Barabba , executive director of market research and planning at General Motors Corp.
" But the reward is that there 's less need to make tradeoffs "
in choosing one 's wheels .
Jeanene Page , of North Salt Lake City , Utah , likes the broader selection .
She wants something big ,
and already has looked at the Chrysler New Yorker and Lincoln Town Car .
Now , the 55-year - old car shopper is zeroing in on a full - sized van ,
figuring
that it 's just the thing
to haul nine grandchildren
and pull a boat at the same time .
" That seems to be what all my friends are using
to take the grandkids to the lake , "
she says .
Market segmentation in cars is n't new ,
but it 's far more extensive
than when Alfred P. Sloan Jr. conceived the idea 50 years ago .
The legendary GM chairman declared
that his company would make " a car for every purse and purpose . "
Now there are many cars for every purse and purpose .
Just four years ago , GM planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments .
Today , they identify 19 distinct segments for cars , and another 11 for trucks and vans .
The number of makes has mushroomed
because the U.S. is the world 's biggest and richest market for automobiles ;
virtually every auto maker wants to sell here .
For every brand like Renault or Fiat
that has been squeezed out ,
others such as Isuzu , Daihatsu and Mitsubishi have come in .
Detroit tries to counter the foreign invasion with new brands of its own .
GM launched the Geo marque this year
to sell cars
made in partnership with foreign auto makers ,
and next year GM 's long - awaited Saturn cars will make their debut .
Ford Motor Co. created the Merkur nameplate in 1985
to sell its German - made touring sedans in the U.S.
But slow sales forced Ford to kill the brand just last week .
When consumers have so many choices ,
brand loyalty is much harder to maintain .
The Wall Street Journal 's " American Way of Buying " survey found
that 53 % of today 's car buyers tend to switch brands .
For the survey , Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization each asked about 2,000 U.S. consumers about their buying habits .
Which cars do Americans favor most these days ?
It 's hard to generalize ,
but age seems to be the best predictor .
Adults under age 30 like sports cars , luxury cars , convertibles and imports far more
than their elders do .
Three of every 10 buyers under 30 would prefer to buy a sports car ,
compared with just 16 % of adults 30 and over ,
according to the Journal survey .
Young consumers prefer luxury cars by a 37 % to 28 % margin
-- even though older buyers ,
because of their incomes ,
are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car .
Perhaps most striking , 35 % of households
headed by people aged 18 to 44
have at least one foreign car .
That 's true of only 14 % of households
headed by someone 60 or older .
Generally , imports appeal most to Americans
who live in the West
and are well - educated , affluent and , especially , young .
" For many baby boomers , buying a domestic car is a totally foreign experience , "
says Christopher Cedergren , auto - market analyst with J.D. Power & Co. of Agoura Hills , Calif.
Such preferences persist
even though many Americans believe
differences between imported and domestic cars are diminishing .
Only 58 % of Americans now believe
that foreign cars get better gas mileage than domestic models ,
the Journal survey found , down from 68 % in 1987 .
Some 46 % give foreign cars higher quality ratings , down from 50 % two years ago .
On the other hand , only 42 % say
foreign cars are less comfortable than U.S. models , down from 55 % in 1987 .
People in the automotive business disagree
over how susceptible younger Americans are to brand switching .
" Once buying habits are formed ,
they 're very hard to break , "
declares Thomas Mignanelli , executive vice president for Nissan 's U.S. sales operations .
But out on Cobb Parkway , Ted Negas sees it differently .
" The competition is so intense
that an owner 's loyalty to a dealership or a car is virtually nonexistent , "
says Mr. Negas , vice president of Ed Voyles Oldsmobile , one of the first dealerships
to locate on the strip .
Thus the very fickleness of baby boomers may make it possible to win them back ,
just as it was possible to lose them .
The battle for customer loyalty is evident along the Cobb Parkway strip .
Ed Voyles Olds recently established a special section in the service department for owners
whose cars are less than a year old ,
so they get quicker service .
Just down the street , Chris Volvo invites serious shoppers to test - drive a new Volvo to any other dealership along the strip , and compare the cars side - by - side .
Manufacturers , too , are stretching further
to lure buyers .
GM 's Cadillac division ,
ignoring Detroit 's long - held maxim
that safety does n't sell ,
is airing television commercials
touting its cars ' safety features .
Cadillac may be on to something .
Some 60 % of the survey respondents said
they would buy anti - lock brakes
even if they carry a medium or high price tag .
More than 50 % felt the same way about air bags .
Both features appealed most to buyers under 45 .
In contrast , dashboard computers , power seats and turbo - charged engines had little appeal .
But even a little appeal has a lot of attraction these days .
GM 's Pontiac division is offering a turbo - charged V-6 engine on its Grand Prix model ,
even though it expects to sell only about 4,000 cars
equipped with that option .
The reason :
Items with narrow appeal can be important in a market as fragmented as today 's .
Americans spent more than $ 190 billion on new cars and trucks last year ,
and just 1 % of that market exceeded Polaroid Co. 's sales of $ 1.86 billion .
" Even if it 's only 1 % , "
says GM 's Mr. Barabba ,
" would you throw away sales the size of Polaroid ? "
( All buyers 47 % )
