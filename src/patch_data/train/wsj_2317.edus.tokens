Elcotel Inc. expects fiscal second - quarter earnings to trail 1988 results ,
but anticipates
that several new products will lead to a " much stronger " performance in its second half .
Elcotel , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ 272,000 , or five cents a share , in its year - earlier second quarter ,
ended Sept. 30 .
Revenue totaled $ 5 million .
George Pierce , chairman and chief executive officer , said in an interview
that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ 4 million
. The lower results ,
Mr. Pierce said ,
reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones , Elcotel 's primary business .
Although Mr. Pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year ,
he said
Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas .
Foremost among those is the company 's entrance into the public facsimile business ,
Mr. Pierce said .
Within the next year , Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines ,
made by Minolta in Japan , in hotels , municipal buildings , drugstores and other public settings around the country .
Elcotel will provide a credit - card reader for the machines
to collect , store and forward billing data .
Mr. Pierce said
Elcotel should realize a minimum of $ 10 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month .
Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor
that will make further use of the company 's system
for automating and handling credit - card calls and collect calls .
Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone ,
Mr. Pierce said ,
not just phones
produced by Elcotel .
The company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones ,
which do n't accept coins ,
for use in hotel lobbies , office lobbies , hospitality lounges and similar settings .
Mr. Pierce estimated
that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ 5 of recurring net earnings for each machine each month .
