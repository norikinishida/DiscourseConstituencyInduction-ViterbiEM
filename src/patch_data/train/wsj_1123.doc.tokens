Blue - chip advertisers have plenty of complaints about the magazines they advertise in , ranging from inadequate consumer research to ad " clutter " and a seemingly unchecked proliferation of special interest magazines .

Criticism from such big advertisers as Estee Lauder Inc. , Colgate - Palmolive Co. and Seagram Co. put a damper on the euphoria at the American Magazine Conference here .
The conference opened Monday with glowing reports about consumer magazines ' growth in circulation and advertising revenue in the past year .

" Magazines are not providing us in - depth information on circulation , " said Edgar Bronfman Jr. , president and chief operating officer of Seagram , in a panel discussion . " How do readers feel about the magazine ?
How deeply do they read it ?
Research does n't tell us whether people actually do read the magazines they subscribe to . "
Reuben Mark , chief executive of Colgate - Palmolive , said advertisers lack detailed demographic and geographic breakdowns of magazines ' audiences . " We need research that convinces us that magazines are a real value in reader 's lives , that readers are really involved . "

The critics also lambasted the magazine industry for something executives often are very proud of : the growth in magazine titles during the 1980s .
Leonard Lauder , president and chief executive officer of Estee Lauder , said consumer magazines are suffering from what he called " niche - itis,"the increasing number of magazines that target the idosyncratic interests of readers .

" Niche - itis fragments our advertising dollars , " said Mr. Lauder . " We are being over - magazined .
We are constantly faced with deciding which partnerships { with magazines } we can keep . " He added : " There 's probably even a magazine for left - handed golfers . . . but the general interest magazine is something we all miss , and it should come back . "

Mr. Lauder also attacked what he sees as the wide imitation of Elle , a fashion magazine published by Diamandis Communications Inc. , and criticized the practice of stacking ads at the front of magazines . " Readers do n't want to face all those ad pages at the front of a magazine , " he said .

Magazine editors did not take the criticisms lying down . " We spend a fortune on research information , " said Steve Burzon , publisher of Meredith Corp. 's Metropolitan Home .

And Tina Brown , editor of Conde Nast Publications Inc. 's Vanity Fair , said advertisers are frequently asked to take advertising positions in the back of her magazine to relieve ad clutter . " But advertisers would n't think of it , " she said .

Bernard Leser , president of Conde Nast , added : " Our research shows we sell more of our heavier issues . . . because readers believe they are getting more for what they pay for . "
