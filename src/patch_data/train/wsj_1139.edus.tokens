Sales of North American - built cars and trucks plunged 20.5 % in mid - October from a year earlier ,
as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year .
" People are waiting for { new } factory giveaways , "
said Ben Kaye , sales manager of Bob Brest Auto World in Lynn , Mass. ,
whose sales are slow .
This trend appears to be especially true at General Motors Corp. ,
which used both dealer and consumer incentives
to ignite sales in August and September .
Since then , deliveries have slumped .
GM 's car sales dropped 24.8 % in mid - October to 69,980 ,
while truck sales fell 26 % to 37,860 .
GM also had dismal results in the first 10 days of the month ,
while other auto makers reported mixed results .
All of the Big Three suffered in the just - ended period , however ,
with sales of all domestically made cars ,
including those built at Japanese - managed plants ,
falling 19 % to 158,863 from a year earlier .
The seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles , a small improvement from the 5.8 million rate of early October , but a big drop from the 7.1 million rate a year ago .
Sales of domestically made trucks also continued to be sluggish in mid - October ,
dropping 22.8 % to 94,543 from a year ago .
The Big Three auto makers already have slashed fourth - quarter production plans 10.4 % below year - ago levels ,
but that may not be enough
to prevent inventories from ballooning
if sales do n't improve .
Industry analyst John H. Qualls , a vice president with Hill & Knowlton in St. Louis , forecasts
that domestic auto makers will have a 93-day supply of cars at the end of the year ,
even if car sales improve to a 6.5 million vehicle rate for the quarter .
Ford Motor Co. reported a 21.2 % drop in sales of domestic - made cars to 46,995 and a 24.2 % drop in domestic trucks to 31,143 .
The sales are being dragged down by a glut of 1989 vehicles ,
said Joel Pitcoff , a Ford analyst .
The earlier use of incentives depleted the market of " scavengers " for bargain - basement 1989 cars ,
he said .
Town & Country Ford in Charlotte , N.C. , still needs to move about 850 1989 cars and trucks .
Business had been fairly strong
until Hurricane Hugo hit the area ,
but has been down since .
Chrysler Corp. also hit the rocks in mid - October .
The No . 3 U.S. auto maker had a 23.7 % plunge in car sales to 22,336 and a 17.5 % drop in truck sales to 22,925 ,
which include its minivans and Jeeps .
Honda Motor Co. ,
which continues to have short supplies of domestically made Accords ,
saw its sales of North American - built cars fall 14.1 % to 8,355 .
But sales of domestic cars and trucks at Nissan Motor Corp. rose 26.1 % to 5,651 .
A Nissan spokesman attributed the increase to the use of incentives this year and not a year ago and to higher fleet sales .
Toyota Motor Corp. ,
which opened a plant in Georgetown , Ky. , last year ,
saw sales triple to 6,256 vehicles .
> a - Totals include only vehicle sales
reported in the period .
c - Domestic car
d - Percent change greater than 999 % .
x - There were 9 selling days in the most recent period and 9 a year earlier .
Percentage differences based on daily sales rate rather than sales volume .
