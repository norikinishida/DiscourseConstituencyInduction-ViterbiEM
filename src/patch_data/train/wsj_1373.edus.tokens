Chip 's Memory Is Here Today , Here Tomorrow
TWO COMPANIES plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits
that store data
even when the power is off .
Today 's most widely used data - storing chips have " volatile " memories
-- their data disappear
if they are n't fed a steady diet of electricity ,
so they need external power supplies .
National Semiconductor Corp. and a start - up
named Ramtron Corp.
plan to start shipping so - called ferroelectric memories ,
which can remember data for at least 10 years
without any current flowing to them .
The chips use materials , such as lead zirconate titanate ,
to form microscopic switches
that retain their data
without electricity .
Developers caution
that broad applications are several years away
because the technology is n't fully refined .
But Ramtron of Colorado Springs , Colo. , plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple ferroelectric chips in December .
The company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices
that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment ,
including floppy - disk and hard - disk drives .
National Semiconductor is getting ferroelectric technology from Krysalis Corp. in Albuquerque , N.M.
National says
it agreed to acquire Krysalis 's assets
and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips ,
including a 4-kilobit memory ,
next year .
Once production hurdles are overcome ,
the chips could take over a significant part of the market .
In addition to not needing an outside power source ,
they are potentially cheaper to make
because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips .
Military buyers have shown interest ,
National says ,
because ferroelectric chips resist atomic radiation .
And
while today 's non - volatile chips
-- such as electronically erasable programmable read - only memory chips --
ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory
because they " learn " data slowly ,
ferroelectric chips accept data at very high speeds .
Showing Up in Court
Without Being There
AN AUSTIN , Texas , company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away
without leaving town .
Witnesses often must travel long distances
to give face - to - face depositions before lawyers and court reporters .
That means huge travel bills .
And telephone or videotape depositions just do n't match physical encounters .
That could change , thanks to lower long - distance rates and cheaper electronics .
Video Telecom Corp. ,
which markets videoconferencing systems ,
is working with court reporters
to wire a nationwide network
to allow depositions by live television .
The company installed a prototype system
that connects Dallas with Miami over digital phone lines .
And it is preparing to set up shop in Chicago , New York and 10 other cities
where court - reporting agencies can tie conference rooms into the network .
While lawyers arranged individual tie - ups before ,
the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper .
An attorney will be able to use the network for an hourly fee of between $ 200 and $ 400 ,
depending on the quality of the picture ,
to take depositions from witnesses in any of the connected cities .
Japanese Reverse Tack On Patent Protection
JAPAN 'S MISUSE of U.S. patents has been a sore point for American chip makers .
Now at least one Japanese company is turning the courtroom tables .
Until now , most Japanese charges have been responses to suits against them .
But last year Hitachi Ltd. surprised Japan 's electronics industry
when it accused Korea 's Samsung Electronics Co. of using Hitachi technology
to make dynamic random - access memory chips .
( A settlement was reached
but was n't made public . )
And Hitachi went on the offensive against the U.S. 's Motorola Inc. earlier this month with a suit
charging
that Motorola 's new MC88200 chip infringes on a Hitachi patent .
Another recent Hitachi suit accuses Motorola of reverse engineering a Hitachi technology
-- a turnabout from a nation of champion reverse engineers .
The moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection
that
patent experts say
Japan is starting to take .
Hitachi made the reverse - engineering charges in an amendment to a counterclaim
filed in a federal district court in Texas
after Motorola sued Hitachi for patent violation .
Hitachi charges
Motorola " has engaged in fraudulent and inequitable conduct in the procurement of certain Motorola patents "
used in Motorola 's MC68030 microprocessor chip .
Translation :
Motorola appears to have taken a Hitachi technology
that is patented in the U.S. ,
Hitachi says ,
and " tried to make it look like a new technology . "
Motorola either denied or would n't comment on the various charges .
Odds and Ends
COMPUTER chips
that simulate human vision
have been developed by Japan 's Sharp Corp.
They mimic the brain
by " looking " at an image ,
extracting the fundamentals
-- boundaries , corners and lines --
and translating them into computer data .
Sharp says
the set of chips could improve fax machines , graphics computers or identification systems
that recognize facial features .
. . . An N.V. Philips unit has created a computer system
that processes video images 3,000 times faster than conventional systems .
Using reduced instruction - set computing , or RISC , chips
made by Intergraph of Huntsville , Ala. ,
the system splits the image
it " sees "
into 20 digital representations , each
processed by one chip .
