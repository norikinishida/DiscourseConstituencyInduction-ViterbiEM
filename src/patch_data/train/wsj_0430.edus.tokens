Nothing was going to hold up the long - delayed settlement of Britton vs. Thomasini .
Not even an earthquake .
On the afternoon of Oct. 17 ,
after hours of haggling with five insurance - claims adjusters
over settling a toxic - waste suit ,
four lawyers had an agreement in hand .
But
as Judge Thomas M. Jenkins donned his robes
so he could give final approval ,
the major earthquake struck , its epicenter not far from his courtroom in Redwood City , Calif.
The walls shook ;
the building rocked .
For a while , it looked like the deal
-- not to mention the courtroom itself --
was on the verge of collapse .
" The judge came out
and said , `
Quick , let 's put this on the record , ' "
says Sandy Bettencourt , the judge 's court reporter .
" I said ,
` NOW ? '
I was shaking the whole time . "
A 10-gallon water cooler had toppled onto the floor ,
soaking the red carpeting .
Lights flickered on and off ;
plaster dropped from the ceiling ,
the walls still shook
and an evacuation alarm blared outside .
The four lawyers climbed out from under a table .
" Let 's close the door , "
said the judge
as he climbed to his bench .
At stake was an $ 80,000 settlement
involving who should pay what share of cleanup costs at the site of a former gas station ,
where underground fuel tanks had leaked
and contaminated the soil .
And the lawyers were just as eager as the judge to wrap it up .
" We were never going to get these insurance companies to agree again , "
says John V. Trump , a San Francisco defense lawyer in the case .
Indeed , the insurance adjusters had already bolted out of the courtroom .
The lawyers went to work anyway ,
duly noting
that the proceeding was taking place during a major earthquake .
Ten minutes later , it was done .
For the record , Jeffrey Kaufman , an attorney for Fireman 's Fund , said
he was " rattled
-- both literally and figuratively . "
" My belief is always ,
if you 've got a settlement ,
you read it into the record . "
says Judge Jenkins ,
now known in his courthouse as " Shake ' Em Down Jenkins . "
The insurance adjusters think differently .
" I did n't know
if it was World War III or what , "
says Melanie Carvain of Morristown , N.J.
" Reading the settlement into the record was the last thing on my mind . "
