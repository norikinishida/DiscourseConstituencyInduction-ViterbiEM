Johnson & Johnson reported a 10 % rise in third - quarter net income on a 12 % sales increase - results that were driven particularly by new products including pharmaceuticals and the company 's professional operations .

Net for the New Brunswick , N.J. , maker of health - care products climbed to $ 265 million , or 80 cents a share , from $ 240 million , or 71 cents a share , in the year - earlier period .
Sales rose to $ 2.45 billion from $ 2.2 billion .
The year - ago per - share earnings are adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split last May.

In a statement , Ralph S. Larsen , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company was pleased with its third - quarter sales performance , " especially in light of the extremely competitive environment in domestic consumer markets and the negative impact of unfavorable exchange rates this quarter . "

David J. Lothson , an industry analyst for PaineWebber Group Inc. , said Johnson & Johnson 's results slightly exceeded his expectations for the third quarter .

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Johnson & Johnson shares fell 37.5 cents to $ 54.625 .

Mr. Larsen noted " substantial sales growth " for the recently introduced Acuvue disposable contact lens and Hismanal , a once - a - day antihistamine .
Eprex , used by dialysis patients who are anemic , and Prepulsid , a gastro - intestinal drug , did well overseas , he said .

Despite health - care cost controls and programs to hold down inventory , the professional division , which makes products including sutures and surgical stapling equipment , " achieved solid growth , " Johnson & Johnson said .

But domestic consumer sales slipped 1.2 % for the quarter , to $ 490 million from $ 496 million .
The company cited softness in the retail health and beauty aids category , " as well as the intense competition in the company 's sanitary protection product line . " Overseas sales were stronger , principally because of a rebound in Brazil , where economic turmoil had hurt year - earlier results , Johnson & Johnson said .

Mr. Lothson of PaineWebber said the company 's sales pace has been picking up largely because the effect of unfavorable exchange rates has been easing -- a pattern continuing this quarter .
He cautioned , however , that a " tough tax - rate comparison " may slow the company 's earnings growth for the current quarter .
For last year 's fourth quarter , the company 's tax rate was less than 20 % , he said .

While the third period contained no major surprises , Mr. Lothson said , the results show how sensitive the multinationals can be to developments in a single country such as Brazil .
He also questioned whether recent gains in that country can be sustained .
