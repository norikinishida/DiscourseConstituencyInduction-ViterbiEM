New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September
after shooting up the month before ,
reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models ,
the Commerce Department reported .
Orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods
expected to last at least three years
dipped 0.1 % last month , to $ 126.68 billion ,
after leaping 3.9 % in August ,
the department said .
Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in August .
Moreover , a recent government report
showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing
had contributed to perceptions
that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a crawl .
But many economists pointed to a 1.8 % September rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category .
That " suggests
the manufacturing sector is not falling apart , "
said Sally Kleinman , an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in New York .
She added , however :
" It is not robust by any means . "
While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total ,
an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped it up .
Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % ,
and a government analyst said
nearly all areas saw increases ,
including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment .
Orders for military goods usually catapult in September ,
government officials say ,
as the Pentagon scrambles to spend its money
before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 .
While all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations ,
a Commerce Department analyst said
that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the wide - ranging surge in defense orders .
Without the increase in defense bookings ,
September orders would have plummeted 3.9 % .
Analysts were most unsettled by evidence
the backlog of orders at factories is slipping .
Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4 % in September , to $ 476.14 billion ,
after declining for the first time in 2 1/2 years in August .
In July unfilled orders grew 1 % .
But analysts noted
that
excluding transportation -
where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures -
order backlogs have declined for three months in a row .
" It means we 're eating into the bread
that keeps us going .
That is a little disturbing , "
Ms. Kleinman said .
" It also means
if you have a real drop - off in orders ,
production will likely fall off very quickly
because there is less
to keep things going . "
Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row ,
posting a 5.6 % drop after a 10.3 % decline .
Such steep drops in a category
seen as a barometer of business investment
would customarily be grave news for the economy .
But a Commerce Department analyst said
that in both months orders would have risen
had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings , a category
that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year .
Still , Milton Hudson , senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York , said :
" If you look back a half - year or so
the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital - goods sector .
Now at least there are question marks about that ,
and without any question the pace of growth has slowed . "
