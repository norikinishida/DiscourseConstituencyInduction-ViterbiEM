As Helen Boehm , who owns an art porcelain company , sipped her luncheon cocktail , she reeled off the names of a few pals -- Prince Charles , Princess Diana , Sarah Ferguson , John Kluge , Milton Petrie .

Then , flashing a diamond ring as big as the Ritz ( " my day diamond , darling " ) , she told her two companions that she is on the " board " of the Vatican Museum in Rome .

As it turns out , the board has a lot of important members , including Winton Blount ( former postmaster general of the U.S. ) , Mrs. Henry Gaisman ( widow of the inventor of auto - strop razor ) and Vincent Murphy ( an investment banker at Merrill Lynch & Co. ) But Mrs. Boehm did n't mention any of them .

" Helen Boehm has a way with names , " says James Revson , a gossip columnist for Newsday ( and son of Joseph Revson , a founder of Revlon ) .
Like which are droppable and which are not .

With the fall social season well under way , name - droppers are out in force , trying to impress their betters and sometimes put down their lessers .
But the truth is that almost everyone , from real - estate agents to city fathers , name - drops ; and a surprising number of people have an ancient uncle who claims he lived next door to the cartoonist who did the Katzenjammer Kids . ( In case you have forgotten , his name was Rudolph Dirks . )

" Name - dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and alienating , " says Herbert Freudenberger , a New York psychoanalyst , with a high - powered clientele . " It can be an avenue of entrance to a certain sector of society . . . . It provides some people a needed sense of affiliation and can help open up a conversation with someone you do n't know . "

Like the Long Island matron in the theater district the other day who swore to a stranger that she once met Liza Minnelli . " I was having a drink in Sardi 's , when all of a sudden I saw a woman 's backside coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing sequined slacks .
I knew it was someone important , so I followed her into the ladies room and sure enough , it was Liza .
So I said , ` Hello . ' And she said , ` Hello . ' Can you imagine ?
Liza said hello to me . "

Some people must drop names -- call it an irresistible impulse . " They ca n't help talking about the big important people they know , even if they do n't really know them , " says Dr. Freudenberger .

Beauregard Houston - Montgomery , a New York writer who changed his name from William Stretch in 1980 , is an inveterate name - dropper . " I do it innately and pathologically , and while it may occasionally get me into trouble , it 's also gotten me access to parties and society , " he says .

Name - dropping recently helped Mr. Houston - Montgomery crash a party Fame magazine threw for 100 of the 2,809 people mentioned in the diaries of the late Andy Warhol . " I guess I might have asked Beauregard to leave , but he drops so many good names , we decided to let him stay , " says Steven Greenberg , publisher of Fame . " After all , Warhol was the ultimate namedropper , dropping five a day in his diaries .
And Beauregard was mentioned twice -- although very briefly and in passing . "

Mr. Houston - Montgomery says that at the party he waved to Malcolm Forbes , publisher of Forbes magazine ( " We 've been in the columns together " ) , Mary Boone , a New York art dealer ( " I think she knows me , but I 'm not sure ") and Bridget Fonda , the actress ( " She knows me , but we 're not really the best of friends " ) .

Mr. Revson , the gossip columnist , says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party .
These droppers do n't flaunt only their friendships with the Trumps , Brooke Astor or Georgette Mosbacher . " They even drop semi - obscure names like Wolfgang Flottl , whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows , " says Mr. Revson . " It 's the one - upsmanship of name - dropping that counts . "

But name - dropping has other benefits , often civic .
In the name of civic pride and from the desire to nullify a negative image , some city promoters seek to link their municipality with the most recognizable names the city has to offer .

Take Cleveland .
It has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily polluted Cuyahoga River caught fire , because former Mayor Ralph Perk set his hair on fire with an acetylene torch and because its proposed Rock ' n ' Roll Hall of Fame was recently refused an urban - development grant .
Some people call it " The Mistake on the Lake " -- Lake Erie , that is .

" It helps to point out how many important people came through Cleveland on their way to the top , " says George Miller , executive director of the New Cleveland Campaign , a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths .

Mr. Miller notes that actor Paul Newman 's family owned a sporting - goods store in Cleveland , that the late actress Margaret Hamilton , who played the bad witch in " The Wizard Of Oz , " once ran a nursery school in Cleveland and that comedian Bob Hope 's father , a stonemason , once worked on a church next to Severence Hall , Cleveland 's main concert hall . " Power names like that do n't hurt the city 's reputation , " Mr. Miller says .

In Hollywood , an average family can gain cachet from moving into a home vacated by the famous or near famous . " Why we even just sold a three - bedroom house in Van Nuys and were able to keep the price firm in a weak real - estate market by noting that the original Lone Ranger lived there , " says David Rambo , a sales associate with Jon Douglas Co. , a Los Angeles real - estate agency . " Most people ca n't even remember his name . " ( It is John Hart . )

Mr. Rambo says that a 3.2-acre property overlooking the San Fernando Valley is priced at $ 4 million because the late actor Erroll Flynn once lived there . " If Flynn had n't lived there , the property might have been priced $ 1 million lower , " says Mr. Rambo , noting that Flynn 's house has been bulldozed , and only the swimming pool remains .

Press agents and public - relations practitioners are notorious name - droppers .
And some even do it with malice aforethought .
Len Kessler , a financial publicist in New York , sometimes uses it to get the attention of journalists who try to avoid him .
He says that when Dan Dorfman , a financial columnist with USA Today , has n't returned his phone calls , he leaves messages with Mr. Dorfman 's office saying that he has an important story on Donald Trump , Meshulam Riklis or Marvin Davis .

He admits he has no story on any of them on these occasions . " But it does get him to return my calls , and it makes me feel better for the times he 's given me the brushoff , " Mr. Kessler says .

There are , of course , obvious dangers to blatant , unsubstantiated name - dropping .
Jeffry Thal , a publicity agent for the Lantz Office in Los Angeles , warns that dropping the wrong name labels the dropper as a fake and a fraud . " Get caught and you 're dead in the water , " says Mr. Thal .

Mr. Thal says that Elizabeth Taylor , a client , " hates being called ` Liz . ' . . . If directors or producers phone me and say they know ` Liz , ' I know they 've never met her .
She prefers ` Elizabeth . ' "
In New York society , Pat Buckley , the very social wife of author William Buckley , has the nicknames " Mrs.
Buckles " and " Patsy . " And her husband sometimes calls her " Ducky . " " But call her ` Patty , ' and it 's a sure giveaway you 're not in her circle , because she does n't use that name , " says Joan Kron , editor - in - chief of Avenue magazine , a monthly publication sent to all the right names .

John Spencer Churchill , a nephew of the late Sir Winston Churchill , former prime minister of Great Britain , is n't that impressed with most name - droppers he meets .
That 's because they only drop " mere names , " says Mr. Churchill .

Currently writing his memoirs , Mr. Churchill , an artist , tells how tycoons such as the late Jean Paul Getty , the oil billionnaire , were , in fact , known only by one initial , their last . " When you 're at the club , you ask whether they 've spoken to ` G. ' Now they know who you mean and you know who you mean .
But no one else does .
Now that 's name - dropping , if you know what I mean . "
